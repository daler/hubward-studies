Insulator peaks in fly Kc cells during the ecdysone response as determined by
ChIP-seq.

Data are available as BED and WIG format files from GEO accession GSE30740. BED
files were minimally processed, by prepending "chr" to chromosome names,
converting negative coordinates to zero, and truncating peaks outside of
chromosome boundaries to the max length of the chromosome.
