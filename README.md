This repository will eventually hold directories of config files for published
studies that can be processed locally with
[hubward](https://github.com/daler/hubward).

The goal is for users to mix-and-match (and contribute!) studies from this
repository to build their own custom track hubs, enabling easy visualization of
published data alongside their own data.
