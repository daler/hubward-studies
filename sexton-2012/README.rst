"Domain coordinates (from dm3 assembly) of the physical
domains, defined by the distance-scaling model as described in Figure 2C. The
epigenomic class of each physical domain, as defined by the clustering
described in Figure 3, is also identified."

Data are from Table S1 from doi:10.1016/j.cell.2012.01.010, and the above text
is the legend from that table.

The original Table S1 is an Excel spreadsheet in BED-like format. Spaces in
feature names were converted to underscores for conversion to bigBed format.

See git@github.com:daler/hubward-studies.git for details on how to reconstruct
this dataset.
