  # Label for this study. The sanitized version of this (non-alphanumeric
  # characters stripped) should be unique among a group.
  label: sexton-2012

  # Optional short label for this study. It will be shown in blue link
  # text in the browser. If not provided, the value of 'label' will be
  # used.
  short_label: Sexton et al 2012 [Hi-C, embryo]

  # Long-form label for this study. This is shown as a title on the
  # study's configuration page. If not provided, the value of
  # 'short_label' will be used.
  long_label: Sexton et al 2012 HiC from embryo

  # Optional reference to study, often copied from reference manager.
  # This will be included in the HTML documentation for the study's page
  # in the genome browser.

  # Description of the study to be included in the HTML documentation.
  # This is assumed to be in ReStructured Text format, which is converted
  # to HTML. If you're using a metadata-builder.py script, a common
  # pattern is to include the contents of a README file in this field.
  # This is by far the most verbose section, and is used to describe where
  # the data came from as well as any processing that was needed to
  # convert into a format supported by the UCSC Genome Browser.
  description: Called domains from Drosophila embryo Hi-C experiments.

# Each item in this list describes a single track in the composite view
# for this study. For each track, hubward will check to see if the
# output file ('processed') is older than the input file ('original') or
# the configured script. If so, then it calls 'script original
# processed' to update the output.
