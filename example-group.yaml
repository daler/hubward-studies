# Group together [possibly many] studies.


# Group name. Will appear as a new section (blue bars) in the genome

name: hubward-example-hub

# Genome assembly
genome: hg19

# Short label for this group. This text will be found in the blue
# section headers in the UCSC Genome Browser.
short_label: Hubward example hub

# Long label for hub. This will be seen in the Description column when
# adding a track hub.
long_label: Example hub for demonstrating hubward

# Upon being uploaded to the server, this is the URL by which the hub
# can be accessed. It is the URL to be pasted into the text box when
# adding a new track hub in the UCSC Genome Browser.

# UCSC requests that email is included on track hubs so they can track

# Configuration for uploading tracks and track hub to a server over
# rsync, called as `rsync <locally-prepared track hub>
# <user>@<host>:<hub_remote>`. If deleted, empty, or set to empty
# strings, then you'll need to provide these details on the command line
# when calling `hubward upload`. Those command line arguments also
# override the corresponding option configured here.
server:

  # Host name where tracks will be rsynced. Override at command line with
  # `--host <HOST>`.
  host: localhost

  # User on `host`. Override on command line with `--user <USERNAME>`. Can
  # use "$USER" to expand to the current username.
  user: $USER

  # Path on `host` to rsync the track hub `hub.txt` file. This file is
  # expected to be served and accessible via the `hub_url` configured
  # above. Override at command line with `--hub_remote <FILENAME>`.

# List of studies to include, as composite tracks, in this hub.
