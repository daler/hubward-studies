Called peaks from GAF ChIP-seq.

BED file was downloaded from GSE40646 and converted to bigBed. The original BED
file used macs to call peaks. The original experiment included 2 replicates of
GAF ChIP-seq in both mock and GAF knockdown S2 cells; the GEO entry contains
only the mock data (a merge of the two replicates).
